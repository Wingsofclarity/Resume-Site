		Music has always been a big part of my life and always will. I studied Game Development - Music and Sound at University of Skövde. The education combined composition, sound design, audio programming, recording, mixing and game analytics. Additionally I took two courses in Sound Engineering at University of Örebro.
	</p>
	<p>
		My speciality is in combining sound and music with visuals and game mechanics. Very simple music or gameplay can be incredible enhanced when combined together. A musical piece that developes as a player in a game progresses or sound effects that doesn't just enhance the experience but is part of the gameplay. Developing an interactive soundscape requires skills in Sound Design, Programming and Game design.

		 I have a personal sound bank including sounds from ambient noises of cities and nature to abstract sound effects created with software. I also have a Sound Cloud account with my composed music.
