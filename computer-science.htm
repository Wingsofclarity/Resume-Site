		I'm a soon-to-be graduated Computer Scientist from Uppsala University. My education and interest is biggest in software development. I'm proficient with a number of programming languages from different paradigms including Erlang, C and Java (see CV for an exhaustive list). I'm most familiar with C-like languages and am specialized in Object-Oriented Design.

		I did my thesis work at Livsmedelsverket (National Food Agency) in Uppsala which was in Object-Oriented Design. A chemist wanted a convinient way to extracte data from PDF-tables. While evaluating existing tools a particular one caught my eye and became the center of the project. The thesis became to be an analysis of the design of the tool on aspects of expanding it.
