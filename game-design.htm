		Like music, games have always been a big part of my life. I have studied various courses within Game Development. In the two of them with a developing project I acted as a leaders bringing the pieces of the games together, maintaining "the vision" and distributing work. Additionally I was part of a development team in Skövde where we created a game for Skövde County.  
	</p>
	<p> 
		I don't play games anymore without analysing the mechanics. I regularly apply concepts such as agon, ludus and paidia presented by Roger Caillois or concepts by Jonathan Blow.  
	</p>
	<p>
	I create artificial worlds and campaigns for pen-and-paper RPGs and run them as a game master. I often use these as a personal playground for mechanics, story and dialogue writing.

	<h2>A graft of Power</h2>
	<p class="pitch">
		In a dystopic future the last attempts of democracy has failed and corruption is just a part of life. The induvidual is nothing but a vote that can be bought and the corporations are doing anything to gain power
	</p>
	<p>
		A graft of power is a board game/card game developed to test mechanics of hidden agendas and diplomacy. Players are representing mega-corporations dependent on the governing laws. Using their resources, players manipulate the government elections to fit their induvidual needs. It was developed as a school project where I lead it and was responsible for the design. It was implemented as an analog card game and a working module for table-top simulator.

	<h2>Hush</h2>
	<p class="pitch">
		In a lab an odd species breaks free and tries to escape. Will security grab you or will you escape.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hush is a game designed to test the most basic mechanics of stealth. It is a procedurely generated endless runner focused on avoiding triggering traps or walking past enemies while they are looking away. It's made in unity by me and my brother as a hobby project for learning. For it I programmed, designed, created music and sound. Neither of us make art so as it stayed as a hobby project the art remained abstract.
	</p>
	<h2>Elins Mysterium</h2>
	<p>
		At University of Sk&#246;vde I was part of a group that developed a game for Sk&#246;vde County. It was supposed to wake an interest for Skövde's history. We created a game where the players walk around Skövde to discover historic buildings and solve puzzles by them. I took part in the overall game design and was responsible for the sound design. I fixed the voice actor, recorded her and mixed the recording. The game is available at istore but only makes sense to play in Skövde.
